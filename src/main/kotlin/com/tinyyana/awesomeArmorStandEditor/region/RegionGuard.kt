/**
 * Universal guard: fires a synthetic [BlockPlaceEvent] and honours any land plugin's veto
 * (GriefPrevention/WorldGuard/Towny/Lands all listen to it). No block is actually placed.
 *
 * This is a *permission query*, not a re-enactment of how our entities appear. We create elements
 * with world.spawn(), which fires no vanilla placement event at all — a land plugin never sees the
 * spawn and so can never veto it directly. The probe asks the equivalent question ("would you let
 * this player build at this block?") and we obey the answer ourselves. Every code path that spawns
 * or teleports an element must call this; nothing downstream will catch a missed one.
 *
 * Must be called on the main thread (edit handlers already are). The event constructor is the
 * public non-deprecated one; EntityPlaceEvent is @ApiStatus.Internal and needs an already-spawned
 * entity, so it cannot serve as a pre-check.
 *
 * Known cost: block loggers (CoreProtect et al.) may record the probe. The placed block is the AIR
 * the player stands in, so most filter it out.
